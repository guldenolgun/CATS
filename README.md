Gene signature refers to a set of genes whose expression characterizes the activity of a specific biological process or a cell state, e.g., EMT, proliferation, stemness, etc. Gene signatures are widely used to infer the state of a biological system based on transcriptomic data. However, the available gene signatures generally lack tissue or cellular context. For instance, a stemness signature derived from one tissue context may not be perfectly applicable to another tissue context. Across tissues, overlapping yet distinct sets of genes are likely to mediate a specific biological process. 

Here, we identify the context-specific gene sets while expanding the network using context-specific and context-agnostic signature sets. Our methodology consists of 3 steps. Each step can be run separately, allowing the user to create their pipeline, or in a combined fashion.
